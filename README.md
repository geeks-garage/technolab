# technolab
All the latest technologies are tried here.

# Add project related docs and info in this repo

 - Find the technologies related books or knowledge in this repo.
 - Add the latest techs related docs or info in this repo and lets create a repo for the same.
 - Create separate folder for each project and add the docs inside each folder.
 - Currently no need to create branches and Pull Requests for now, we can decide later to add this in.
 - Here is the github markdown cheat sheet link `https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet` to write `.md` files like this one you are reading.
 
 # Happy coding
